Bukit Vista: AI-Powered Property Search Engine
This project is a Streamlit web application that serves as a proof-of-concept for GAIA, Bukit Vista's AI assistant. It transforms a raw, messy property inventory dataset into a powerful, two-part business intelligence tool:

An Interactive EDA Dashboard for the internal team to visualize and understand the property portfolio.

A "Semantic Search" Engine that allows the sales team or GAIA to find properties based on natural language intent (e.g., "a quiet villa with a pool") rather than rigid filters.
