by looking out of the window, you surfers can see if the wave is good or not, before deciding to get down and ride the wave. important notes since this villa is located on a coastal cliff with hundreds of steps, we advise you not to check-in at night because it will be easier to get lost and difficult to see the direction. make sure your suitcase or luggage is light, or ask the porter to carry it down and pay for the effort they have expended (as agreed with them). this is bali, monkeys running around is a natural thing! likewise in bingin, maybe the monkeys will visit your villa.
